<Layout>

### Our code goes through a very similar process.

<Appear>

It starts small

It grows

We combine smaller parts to make bigger parts

</Appear>

<Notes>
Like a seedling, it starts small

It eventually grows more complex

We compose (arrange) smaller pieces of code together to make something more useful than the individual parts

...

But managing this in code is difficult, we don't have constructs like starter pots or big planter baskets.  So how, then, do we bring order to this chaos?
