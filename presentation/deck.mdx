# What do I do now?
### I'm a gardener

j/k it's a metaphor

### I'm a gardener, and my code is a garden.

It's _FULL_ of weeds.

# How do I remove the weeds safely?

🤔 OK cool.  How do you do that?

That's great! I'm bored; can we _do_ something?

Heck yes we can.

Making a site search component, the atomic way.
<div style={{
  background: '#EEE5E5',
  padding: '36px 24px',
  border: '1px solid #DDCECD',
  width: '400px',
  display: 'flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  margin: '0 auto',
  fontSize: '16px',
}}>
    <SiteSearch />
</div>

☝️The goal.

<button
    onClick={e => {
        document.getElementById('here-we-go').style.display = 'block'
        e.target.style.display = 'none'
    }}
    style={{
        padding: '12px 24px',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        fontSize: '24px',
        textTransform: 'uppercase',
        background: '#28AFB0',
        border: 'none',
        borderRadius: '6px',
    }}

    Click here when you're ready
</button>
<img 
    id="here-we-go"
    style={{display: 'none'}}
