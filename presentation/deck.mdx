# What do I do now?
### I'm a gardener

I like to make potted plant arrangements, like this one.

---

### Like any gardener, I searched for a sane way to manage my plants from seed to harvest.  So, I learned about seed starter pots.

### After a few weeks the seeds have turned to seedlings.
But they are starting to outgrow their starter pots. They need a bigger home, so I move them to a larger pot.

A few more weeks goes by, and they are ready to plant in an arrangement.  :tada:

### Ugh...  What does making plant arrangements have to do with my code?

---

### Our code goes through a very similar process when we make it.
- It starts small, needing only a small home
- It eventually grows more complex (bigger), needing a larger home
- We eventually need to mix the smaller piecs of code together to make something larger

🤔 OK cool.  How do you do that?

## Atomic Design Borrows From Chemistry
by using names that we can all understand.

Making a site search component, the atomic way.
<div style={{
  background: '#EEE5E5',
  padding: '36px 24px',
  border: '1px solid #DDCECD',
  width: '400px',
  display: 'flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  margin: '0 auto',
  fontSize: '16px',
}}>
    <SiteSearch />
</div>

☝️The goal.
